			<h1 class="PageHeadTitle">My Journey To Creating This Website</h1>

			<button><a href="site_backlog.html">Backlog</a></button>

			<p class="PageDescription">This journal comprises of the activities for each day I worked on the website. The entries include: what I learned, ideas for the website, and my open thoughts.<br/><br/>

			I am creating a webpage that explains my interests in my career and outside of my career. This is a webpage that will supplement my resume, and help recruiters understand who I am as a person.<br/><br/>

			In addition to creating a bio about myself and past experiences, I am using this project as my method for learning about web development starting off with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

			<h3><b>The Journey</b></h3>

			<p class="Notice">The resources that I will be using to help me on the journey will be cited at the end if you are interest in creating your own webpage. I will also include what topics I looked for when learning these new languages.</p>

			<h3>Day 1 - April 25, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">I started off looking at a sample code to understand what I will be expecting. The very first thing I saw was <!DOCTYPE html>. DOCTYPE isn't in any of the languages that I know, so this is the first thing I Googled, and I came across <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp">w3schoools' resources</a>. There were also various tags that are used, and the explanation in the resource referred to them as elements. I Googled 'html elements', and I found w3schools' <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_paragraphs.asp">tutorial</a> about various resources.<br/><br/>

			From what I understood, the only thing html can do by itself is organize text with various fonts. In order for me to use colors extensively and design the webpage, I would need to use CSS. According to w3schools there's <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp">three different ways I can use CSS</a> with HTML: inline, internal, and external.<br/><br/>

			Now I bring in JavaScript. I've heard about JavaScript a lot, but I never quite understood how it was used with web development. From <a href="http://study.com/academy/lesson/what-is-javascript-function-uses-quizhtml">study.com's explanation</a>, my take away is that JavaScript is create the behavior or the webpage on the client side. To use JavaScript with the program, I just use the 'script' tag.</p>

			<h3>Day 2 - April 26, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Trying to understand the purpose of the title tag. According to the image on <a href="https://moz.com/learn/seo/title-tag">moz.com</a>, every tab in a browser has a title. Before I applied the title tag, my tab only had my web address on it. After applying a title, it says 'Jerry Chen: The Journey'.<br/><br/>

			Learning how to add photos through <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_images.asp">w3school</a>. It appears that common practice is creating a subdirectory called 'images' and adding all the photos into that directory (folder). Then I use HTML to pull the photo from the folder and add attributes to it.</p>

			<h3>Day 3 - May 24, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Most of my learning today will be through <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html-css"></a>link(7). I thought it would be easier to learn HTML and CSS through an organized lesson by codeacademy. I learned the title should always be in the the head element, so I corrected my code and moved the title element.<br/><br/>

			I then learned about two types of lists unordered and ordered lists. Unordered are bullet point lists and ordered lists have numerical associations. The "ul" and "ol" elements can't interpret raw text, but it can organize "li" elements together.<br/><br/>

			In order to add hyperlinks connecting my webpage to the rest of the internet, I need to use "a" (aka anchor element). In addition to using the "a" element, I need to add an attribute href, which lives in the openning tag. There's two parts of an attribute: name of attribute and value of attribute. The name in this case is href, and the value is the web address string. Cool stuff. The anchor element also has a target attribute, which opens the link in a new window (new tabs in modern browsers). The value for target is "_blank". The cool thing about the an anchor element is that you can wrap any other element with "a" and it becomes a link of some form.<br/><br/>

			The img element are self closing elements. Meaning it only has an openning tag that ends with />. I have used the src, alt, and style attributes. The src is like href but for an image, which could be an address to the image or an image in a local directory. alt is the the text that shows if the image doesn't load properly. style is how the image should be displayed.<br/><br/>

			CSS is used to modify the text of HTML to become visually appealing. According to Code Academy, it can be used to modify colors, font types, font sizes, shadows, images, element positioning, and more. The inline CSS, as I learned about in a previous day, must be placed in the head element. The general syntax of CSS is an element selector followed by curly brackets and it's contents. For example, all elements that are selected will have these values. * is the universal selector<br/><br/>
			
			selector {<br/>
			property: value;<br/>
			}<br/><br/>

			It's generally good practice to separate HTML and CSS code into two separate folders even though CSS can be incorporated into the head element of HTML. The "link" element is used to associated the two files together. Similar to a #include in C and C++ but different. It must be included in the head element that requires the following attributes: href, type, rel. href is the path to the CSS file. type is the type of document, which is text/css in this case. rel is the relationship between the two, in this case it's a "stylesheet".</p>

			<h3>Day 4 - May 25, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Learning about colors for CSS. There's 3 different ways to specify the color values: using named colors (<a href="http://www.colors.commutercreative.com/grid/">147 named colors</a>), using rgb values (each ranging from 0-256: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">adobe's color theme software</a>), or hex values, which are the same as rgb values but different representation. to represent rgb use rgb(red, green, blue).<br/><br/>

			Aside from these three representations, there's also HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness). Hue is the color wheel from 0 to 360. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color from 0% to 100% where it represents the shade of gray and 100% is full saturation. Lightness is the amount of white in a color. Like saturation, it ranges from 0% to 100%, but 0% is black, 100% is white, and %50 is normal. To represent hsl we use hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).</p>

			<h3>Day 5 - May 26, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Colors have another property in addition to the rgb intensities called an alpha channel. The alpha channel is used for transparency. The lower the value the more transparent, the greater the value more opaque. To specify this value in addition to rgb, you use rgba(). The alpha channel ranges from 0 to 1 for all real numbers. According to codeacademy, we can declare both rgb and rgba in case the older browser doesn't support the alpha channel. The fallback color should precede rgba color. hsl function also supports the alpha opacity channel.<br/><br/>

			After colors, I learned about fonts. serif and sans-serif are two types of fonts. Serif has extra strokes on the ends of the characters whereas sans-serif don't, which creates a cleaner look. When selecting the font-family property, the developer can specify multiple fonts separated by commas. The left most font is used and each one to the right are fallbacks if the browser doesn't support the font.<br/><br/>

			<a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a> has a ton of fonts that web developers can import to design their websites. To import the font, you will need to use the link element where the href value is equal to: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Barrio" where Barrio is replaced with the font you want, and spaces are replaced with '+'. The type value is "text/css" and the rel value is "stylesheet". The element should be placed in the head element. I experimented with the positioning of the element with respect to the link element containing the style sheet that uses the font, and it appears that it doesn't matter if the font is included before or after the css file unlike C or C++.<br/><br/>
		  
			According to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14676613/how-to-import-google-web-font-in-css-file">stack overflow's explanation</a>, there is another way to import the font with the @import method, but in this case, it must be the first thing in the file.</p>

			<h3>Day 6 - May 27, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Learning how to interact html with javascript code. I assume that it's similar to css in the sense that it can be external or internal since <a href="http://www.dummies.com/web-design-development/javascript/javascript-and-html/">dummies.com</a> shows an internal method using the script tag then using an attribute specifying that it's the language JavaScript. According to the link, buttons have an attribute called onClick that has the value of a function. If I remember correctly this is similar to XML on Android Studio. The attribute makes the button call the specified JavaScript Function when it is clicked. My assumption was correct, the link then goes on to explain how to import an extern JavaScript file. The syntax is the same as the internal method, but there's an extra attribute called src which has the value of the extern file's path or web address.</p>

			<h3>Day 7 - May 28, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Although I have learned enough HTML and CSS to have a basic understanding of how to start working on my website, I realized I don't have a focus for my website. What do I want it show? What's the purpose/goal? How should I format it? These are a few of the questions I realized I should be asking myself. Since the start of this web development journey, I only had an full answer to what I want to show, and I had a little answer for what's the purpose. I wanted a way to show what I have done (career and non career), what are my interests (hobbies), what are my aspirations and inspirations. These are the types of these that I want to show. Perhaps I want to have a section of the website to be a blog. I know that in the end, I want my experiences to be a resource for anyone that is interested the broad field of computer science/programming/engineering.<br/><br/>

			Eventually, I'll want to move these day to day contents to the website. These day to day contents are only suppose to be about my journey to creating my website, and perhaps anything else I add to the site. This is in the readme file because I have no where else to show the activities haha. I'm going to add a webpage that will be the foundation of this journal.<br/><br/>

			In addition to figuring out the content, I also need to figure out the layout. I did some searches and it seems like <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/steps-perfect-website-layout-812625">this blog</a> about "23 steps to the perfect website" is a good way to start. It explains some key points of a website design, and what I need to focus on.<br/><br/>

			I believe that I will be including code snippets regularly at some point... So <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4707878/how-do-i-insert-code-examples-into-an-html-file">stackoverflow</a> explains that if I wanted to add code text I can use the xmp tag. This tag makes html not process anything in between the tags, and treats it as regular text.<br/><br/>

			According to this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2336302/single-huge-css-file-vs-multiple-smaller-specific-css-files">stack overflow thread</a> "single huge .css files vs multiple smaller specific .css files", there's an efficiency difference between one css file vs multiple css files. Having one CSS file is more efficient because there's less http requests. Based on the in-depth explanation on <a href="https://www.quora.com/Does-writing-a-separate-style-sheet-for-each-HTML-document-decrease-your-websites-efficiency">quora</a> about the same topic, CSS files are cached when it gets loaded. That way if the same file is needed again by another page, it can use the cached version instead of loading a new file. This explains a lot of the problems I've been having where I update the CSS file, and it doesn't affect my page when I refresh it. The page is still using the old cached CSS file.<br/><br/>

			Right now, I'm using link(#) to reference a resource at the end of this journal. I'll be changing it later when I figure out how I want to do the referencing aside from simply using an anchor element.</p>

			<h3>Day 8 - June 22, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">I added a simple Navigation Bar by following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQgqJG8ld7M">this youtube tutorial</a>. This guy did a very good job at explaining/demonstrating the process. For the time being I will keep it how it is to observe the visual affects it has on the website. When I get the change later I will be changing the design and make it more personalized.<br/><br/>

			There appears to be an unintentional affect. There's some sort of margin around the Navigation Bar. When I remove all other styling from the css file the margin is still around the Bar. I'm not quite sure where this problem is coming from, but I will need to investigate or ask for help from someone.<br/><br/>

			I decided to set margins to 0px and it appears to have an affect to the Navigation Bar. It partially closed the gap between the top of the webpage and the top of the Bar. Perhaps there are uninitialized values that I didn't account for, which doesn't make sense. 0px should be the default value if the margin isn't specified.<br/><br/>

			It seems that I fixed the problem. Here's what I have added. left: 0px and top: 0px. It seems that these two properties don't have the value of 0px, which makes sense why the Navigation Bar is offset from the sides and top of the screen. I tested this out when I added the two properties: position and width. I added the position so I can keep it fixed to a specific location as the rest of the screen scrolls. I added width to be 100% because adding position caused the Navigation Bar to shrink to only the necessary size around the two links: Home and Web Journal. Now I have an ideal simple Navigation Bar. Also the margin 0px that I added earlier seems to be required. Without it the top of the Bar still offsets slightly. This seems strange since I had the top property set to 0px.<br/><br/>

			I noticed that adding the position to be fixed caused the initial content to hide behind the navigation bar. I searched for a solution and came across a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10865237/website-header-hiding-behind-content-when-position-is-fixed">stack overflow explanation</a>. I ended up adding a padding-top: 40px. This pushed the content down. This is an interesting solution, now the bottom of the Navigation Bar acts like the top of the body.</p>

			<h3>Day 9 - June 24, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Today I decided to make the modifications to the Navigation Bar, Nav Bar for short. I will be adding some icons to the bar to make it a little more fancy. I found some icons at the <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/">iconarchive.com</a>. There's all sorts of icons that you can use. I'll be picking simple ones so that it's not too overwhelming to the viewers. I will also be adding on to the implementation of the Nav Bar by building onto what the YouTube video suggested.<br/><br/>

			To start off, I need to change the implementation of the Nav Bar because using a list is a bit restrictive. With a list, All my items must be clumped together, I can't place one item to the far left and all the other items to the center. To fix this problem, I created a container class outside of the list. The container becomes my Nav Bar and the list becomes an item. In the future, I will be able to add a unique icon that represents my website in addition to the navigation links and any other items I want to add for ease of access. By adding this container, I needed to make some modifications to the positioning in the style file. Instead of a fixed position for the list, I changed it to absolute. According to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_position.asp">w3school</a>, this based the positioning of the NavBar relative to its first positioned ancestor element. When I add properties such as bottom, left, top, right. It will stay contained within the container element and not the body element.<br/><br/>

			I accidentally zoomed in on a page and the items started moving out of place. I will have to fixed this problem a different time... Turns out the problem was because I used percentage values for the height of the Nav Bar and the padding-top for the body. When you zoom in, the size of the elements also change to maintain the percentage values.<br/><br/>

			The icon idea was scrapped because it complicates the design. For user experience, icons are also less descriptive than words. Using words are makes it easier to navigate the website. I am now back to square one figuring out how to position the items. I might follow the design of StackOverflow's Nav Bar.<br/><br/>

			It appears that I went full circle, I decided to remove the container all together.</p>

			<h3>Day 10 - June 25, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Added a GitHub icon and some styling to the footer. It's not what I want so far, but it will have to do. Ideally, I want the footer to come up at the end of the page, but this decision may change in the future to make it readily accessible, instead of hiding the icon at the end of the page. The icon's positioning is causing a problem, I am trying to center it. In the end I may just change this footer container to an unordered list.</p>

			<h3>Day 11 - June 28, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">Briefly made some adjustments, I changed a div element to a ul element. Either I have a style problem or an element problem, but I want the width to touch the ends of the body without having to use width: 100%. Using width 100% makes the footer and header also increase size because it's trying to match the width of the new zoomed screen.</p>

			<h3>Day 12 - July 3, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">My resume was originally under the CV link on the navigation bar. I removed it fromt he CV page. Instead, I added a link to the pdf of my Resume to the Navigation Bar because I believe that the most important information to the viewer should be a single click away, supplementary categories should be at least 2 clicks away, and everything else can be determined by what main categories they fall under. The linked in icon was added to the footer.<br/><br/>

			I plan on adding a backlog to the Website Journal page. This will help me keep track of what I need to do whenever I get the chance to work on the website and keep viewers, who are interested in the progress of the site, updated. Added a button for the backlog on the journal because it didn't seem obvious that the word backlog was a hyperlink unless the user intuitively hovered over every word. This is a temporary design. When drop downs are added to the navigation bar, I will be moving it into the drop down. I will continue development later, I need to make some salmon for dinner.</p>

			<h3>Day 13 - August 26, 2017</h3>

			<p class="JournalEntry">I modified the main content on the home page by adding a short about me content. I also changed the background color and centered the content. Ideally I want to choose a more appealing color scheme, but for now black text on white background should be sufficient. I scrunched the text towards the center since it's easier to read lines that are shorter than text that span the whole screen.<br/><br/>

			I also got around to removing the link(#) text on this page and changed them to hyper links.</p>
