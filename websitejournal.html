	<h1 class="PageHeadTitle">My Journey To Creating This Website</h1>

	<p class="PageDescription">This journal comprises of the activities for each day I worked on the website. The entries include: what I learned, ideas for the website, and my open thoughts.<br/>

	I am creating a webpage that explains my interests in my career and outside of my career. This is a webpage that will supplement my resume, and help recruiters understand who I am as a person.<br/>

	In addition to creating a bio about myself and past experiences, I am using this project as my method for learning about web development starting off with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

	<h3><b>The Journey</b></h3>

	<p class="Notice">The resources that I will be using to help me on the journey will be cited at the end if you are interest in creating your own webpage. I will also include what topics I looked for when learning these new languages.</p>

	<h3>Day 1</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">I started off looking at a sample code to understand what I will be expecting. The very first thing I saw was <!DOCTYPE html>. DOCTYPE isn't in any of the languages that I know, so this is the first thing I Googled, and I came across the link(1). There were also various tags that are used, and the explanation in the link(1) referred to them as elements. I Googled 'html elements', and I found the link(2), which turns out to be a tutorial with various resources.<br/>

	From what I understood, the only thing html can do by itself is organize text with various fonts. In order for me to use colors extensively and design the webpage, I would need to use CSS. According to link(3) there's three different ways I can use CSS with HTML: inline, internal, and external.<br/>

	Now I bring in JavaScript. I've heard about JavaScript a lot, but I never quite understood how it was used with web development. In link(4), my take away is that JavaScript is create the behavior or the webpage on the client side. To use JavaScript with the program, I just use the 'script' tag.</p>

	<h3>Day 2</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Trying to understand the purpose of the title tag. According to the image in the link(5). Every tab in a browser has a title. Before I applied the title tag, my tab only had my web address on it. After applying a title, it says 'Jerry Chen: The Journey'.<br/>

	Learning how to add photos using link(6). It appears that common practice is creating a subdirectory called 'images' and adding all the photos into that directory. Then I use HTML to pull the photo from the folder and add attributes to it.</p>

	<h3>Day 3</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Most of my learning today will be through link(7). I thought it would be easier to learn HTML and CSS through an organized lesson by codeacademy. I learned the title should always be in the the head element, so I corrected my code and moved the title element.<br/>

	I then learned about two types of lists unordered and ordered lists. Unordered are bullet point lists and ordered lists have numerical associations. The "ul" and "ol" elements can't interpret raw text, but it can organize "li" elements together.<br/>

	In order to add hyperlinks connecting my webpage to the rest of the internet, I need to use "a" (aka anchor element). In addition to using the "a" element, I need to add an attribute href, which lives in the openning tag. There's two parts of an attribute: name of attribute and value of attribute. The name in this case is href, and the value is the web address string. Cool stuff. The anchor element also has a target attribute, which opens the link in a new window (new tabs in modern browsers). The value for target is "_blank". The cool thing about the an anchor element is that you can wrap any other element with "a" and it becomes a link of some form.<br/>

	The img element are self closing elements. Meaning it only has an openning tag that ends with />. I have used the src, alt, and style attributes. The src is like href but for an image, which could be an address to the image or an image in a local directory. alt is the the text that shows if the image doesn't load properly. style is how the image should be displayed.<br/>

	CSS is used to modify the text of HTML to become visually appealing. According to Code Academy, it can be used to modify colors, font types, font sizes, shadows, images, element positioning, and more. The inline CSS, as I learned about in a previous day, must be placed in the head element. The general syntax of CSS is an element selector followed by curly brackets and it's contents. For example, all elements that are selected will have these values. * is the universal selector<br/>
	
	<xmp>selector {
	  property: value;
	}</xmp><br/>

	It's generally good practice to separate HTML and CSS code into two separate folders even though CSS can be incorporated into the head element of HTML. The "link" element is used to associated the two files together. Similar to a #include in C and C++ but different. It must be included in the head element that requires the following attributes: href, type, rel. href is the path to the CSS file. type is the type of document, which is text/css in this case. rel is the relationship between the two, in this case it's a "stylesheet".</p>

	<h3>Day 4</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Learning about colors for CSS. There's 3 different ways to specify the color values: using named colors (147 colors: link(8)), using rgb values (each ranging from 0-256: link(9)), or hex values, which are the same as rgb values but different representation. to represent rgb use rgb(red, green, blue).<br/>

	Aside from these three representations, there's also HSL (Hue, Saturation, and Lightness). Hue is the color wheel from 0 to 360. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color from 0% to 100% where it represents the shade of gray and 100% is full saturation. Lightness is the amount of white in a color. Like saturation, it ranges from 0% to 100%, but 0% is black, 100% is white, and %50 is normal. To represent hsl we use hsl(hue, saturation, lightness).</p>

	<h3>Day 5</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Colors have another property in addition to the rgb intensities called an alpha channel. The alpha channel is used for transparency. The lower the value the more transparent, the greater the value more opaque. To specify this value in addition to rgb, you use rgba(). The alpha channel ranges from 0 to 1 for all real numbers. According to codeacademy, we can declare both rgb and rgba in case the older browser doesn't support the alpha channel. The fallback color should precede rgba color. hsl function also supports the alpha opacity channel.<br/>

	After colors, I learned about fonts. serif and sans-serif are two types of fonts. Serif has extra strokes on the ends of the characters whereas sans-serif don't, which creates a cleaner look. When selecting the font-family property, the developer can specify multiple fonts separated by commas. The left most font is used and each one to the right are fallbacks if the browser doesn't support the font.<br/>

	Link(10) has a ton of google fonts that web developers can import to design their websites. To import the font, you will need to use the link element where the href value is equal to: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Barrio" where Barrio is replaced with the font you want, and spaces are replaced with '+'. The type value is "text/css" and the rel value is "stylesheet". The element should be placed in the head element. I experimented with the positioning of the element with respect to the link element containing the style sheet that uses the font, and it appears that it doesn't matter if the font is included before or after the css file unlike C or C++.<br/>
  
	According to stack overflow in link(11), there is another way to import the font with the @import method, but in this case, it must be the first thing in the file.</p>

	<h3>Day 6</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Learning how to interact html with javascript code. I assume that it's similar to css in the sense that it can be external or internal since link(12) shows an internal method using the script tag then using an attribute specifying that it's the language JavaScript. According to the link, buttons have an attribute called onClick that has the value of a function. If I remember correctly this is similar to XML on Android Studio. The attribute makes the button call the specified JavaScript Function when it is clicked. My assumption was correct, the link then goes on to explain how to import an extern JavaScript file. The syntax is the same as the internal method, but there's an extra attribute called src which has the value of the extern file's path or web address.</p>

	<h3>Day 7</h3>

	<p class="JournalEntry">Although I have learned enough HTML and CSS to have a basic understanding of how to start working on my website, I realized I don't have a focus for my website. What do I want it show? What's the purpose/goal? How should I format it? These are a few of the questions I realized I should be asking myself. Since the start of this web development journey, I only had an full answer to what I want to show, and I had a little answer for what's the purpose. I wanted a way to show what I have done (career and non career), what are my interests (hobbies), what are my aspirations and inspirations. These are the types of these that I want to show. Perhaps I want to have a section of the website to be a blog. I know that in the end, I want my experiences to be a resource for anyone that is interested the broad field of computer science/programming/engineering.<br/>

	Eventually, I'll want to move these day to day contents to the website. These day to day contents are only suppose to be about my journey to creating my website, and perhaps anything else I add to the site. This is in the readme file because I have no where else to show the activities haha. I'm going to add a webpage that will be the foundation of this journal.<br/>

	In addition to figuring out the content, I also need to figure out the layout. I did some searches and it seems like link(13) is a good way to start. It explains some key points of a website design, and what I need to focus on.<br/>

	I believe that I will be including code snippets regularly, at some point... So link(14) explains that if I wanted to add code text I can use the xmp tag. This tag makes html not process anything in between the tags, and treats it as regular text.<br/>

	According to link(15), there's an efficiency difference between one css file vs multiple css files. Having one CSS file is more efficient because there's less http requests. Based on the explanation in link(16), CSS files are cached when it gets loaded. That way if the same file is needed again by another page, it can use the cached version instead of loading a new file. This explains a lot of the problems I've been having where I update the CSS file, and it doesn't affect my page when I refresh it. The page is still using the old cached CSS file.<br/>

	Right now, I'm using link(#) to reference a resource at the end of this journal. I'll be changing it later when I figure out how I want to do the referencing aside from simply using an anchor element.</p>
