CSS file wasn't working in conjunction with HTML file.
I originally used internal css to test colors, and my webpage showed correctly. When I added an external css file to replace the original internal. I migrated the code over and the webpage stopped displaying the proper colors. Only the html code was working. I double checked the file name with the href value and it was the same. I requested for help on Programming Discussion Discord. Someone pointed out that ref should be rel (I mistakenly put ref thinking reference). Two others inspected my webpage and saw that it was showing Chinese characters in addition to the lack of css styling. They pointed out that I should check the encoding of my files. Apparently my css file was saved as ucs-2, which is 4 bytes per character. I went to sublime and saved file with encoding utf-8, which is 2 bytes per character. This fixed my problems with the Chinese characters and lack of style. The browser now understands to read my files as 2 bytes per character. Perhaps write a blog about it.

Sometimes when I update the css and html files, the html file loads properly, but the css file doesn't load properly. On my github all the files are correct, but when I inspect the the page and checked the source code the css code isn't correct. When I shift+refresh everything ends up being okay, but if I have returning viewers for the webpage and they don't clear their cache they will have the same problem. Perhaps I can fix it in the source code. Otherwise it's a client problem.
