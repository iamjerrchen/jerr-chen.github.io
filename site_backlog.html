			<p class="PageDescription">The following will be a list of ideas or bug fixes that need to be made on the website. There will three categories: Inactive, Active, and Completed. Inactive are ideas that haven't been started yet. Active are the inactive ideas that have been started and are work in progress. Completed are the ideas that have been completed and are listed for future reference. Ideally there should only be a few items active at any point in time to keep a focus on the progress. For all items, there should be a date included to inform when the idea was conceived, started, or completed. Completed items should also include which website journal entry the item is associated with.<br/></p>


			<h3>Inactive:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Integrate the links at the bottom of the website journal into the text specifying where the links should go. (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Recolor the website pages so that it's more pleasing to the viewer. Use conventional colors. (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Change the design of the header and footer so that items can be positioned in various locations on the bar. (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Write an about content on the front page. The content can contain: passions, education, goals, influences... (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Add drop down options to the Navigation Bar so that I can include the backlog link directly under the website journal link instead of requiring the viewer to navigate to the journal page then the backlog page. (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Consolidate the stylesheet so that it's easier to read. Remove any unused styles. (7/3/17)</li>
				<li>Learn and apply dynamic webpages so that zooming into the page doesn't make the page unreadable. (9/2/17)</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Active:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Add content to the CV page. Use this page to add detailed career experiences. (9/2/17)</li>
				<li></li>

			</ul>

			<h3>Completed:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Changed the listed links to embedded links on the website journal page. (8/26/17)</li>

			</ul>
