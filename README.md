My Webpage =)

I am creating a webpage for myself that explains my interests in my career and outside of my career. This is a webpage that will supplement my resume, and help recruiters understand who I am as a person.

In addition to creating a bio about myself and past experiences, I am using this project as my method for learning about web development starting off with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### <b>The Journey</b>
The resources that I will be using to help me on the journey will be cited below if you are interest in creating your own webpage. I will also include what topics I looked for when learning these new languages.

##### DAY 1
<p>I started off looking at a sample code to understand what I will be expecting. The very first thing I saw was <!DOCTYPE html>. DOCTYPE isn't in any of the languages that I know, so this is the first thing I Googled, and I came across the link(1). There were also various tags that are used, and the explanation in the link(1) referred to them as elements. I Googled 'html elements', and I found the link(2), which turns out to be a tutorial with various resources.</p>
<p>From what I understood, the only thing html can do by itself is organize text with various fonts. In order for me to use colors extensively and design the webpage, I would need to use CSS. According to link(3) there's three different ways I can use CSS with HTML: inline, internal, and external.</p>
<p>Now I bring in JavaScript. I've heard about JavaScript a lot, but I never quite understood how it was used with web development. In link(4), my take away is that JavaScript is create the behavior or the webpage on the client side. To use JavaScript with the program, I just use the 'script' tag.</p>

##### DAY 2
<p>Trying to understand the purpose of the title tag. According to the image in the link(5). Every tab in a browser has a title. Before I applied the title tag, my tab only had my web address on it. After applying a title, it says 'Jerry Chen: The Journey'.</p>
<p>Learning how to add photos using link(6). It appears that common practice is creating a subdirectory called 'images' and adding all the photos into that directory. Then I use HTML to pull the photo from the folder and add attributes to it.</p>
