My Webpage =)

I am creating a webpage for myself that explains my interests in my career and outside of my career. This is a webpage that will supplement my resume, and help recruiters understand who I am as a person.

In addition to creating a bio about myself and past experiences, I am using this project as my method for learning about web development starting off with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
