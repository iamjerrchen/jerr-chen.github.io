        <p>Please bear with me while I figure out the layout and content that I want to place onto the website.<br/><br/>
        Hi! The name is Jerry. I grew up in a large town called Moline, Illinois and attended Moline Sr. High School. After high school, I moved to University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign for college, which is where I am currently at. I am in the class of 2019 for undergrad pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Engineering, quickly developing an interest in Cyber Security, Data Science, and Software Development. Currently, I am considering the joint undergraduate and graduate program provided by the college.<br/><br/>
        On my website, you can find various information such as my resume, detailed summary of my career (CV), the journey of creation of my website, etc.
        </p>
